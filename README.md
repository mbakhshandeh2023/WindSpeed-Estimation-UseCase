### Description

This use case demonstrates a Jupyter notebook developed to assign hurricane wind speeds to property locations in Florida that were damaged during past storm events. The tool supports both insurance claim datasets and post-disaster reconnaissance data, enabling users to analyze spatial variations in wind intensity at property level.The Wind Speed Estimation and Conversion Use Case processes wind-field input data provided in any grid format and for multiple exposure conditions—such as marine, open terrain, or urban terrain—and across various time averages, including 3-second gusts, 1-minute sustained winds, and 10-minute averages. It also allows conversion of wind speeds between reference heights using established wind-engineering relationships.

Since 2017, Applied Research Associates (ARA), under contract with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has produced high-resolution hurricane wind-field datasets that include 10-m 3-second gust and 1-minute sustained wind values over open terrain. These datasets are published in the DesignSafe Reconnaissance Portal and serve as a recommended input source for this use case, though any compatible gridded dataset may be used. In addition to the wind field data, the use case requires property location files (latitude and longitude) and terrain roughness coefficients, which are extracted from GeoTIFF rasters, which describe surface roughness (urban, suburban, coastal, etc.) for the state of Florida. These rasters can be updated or replaced for other regions, enabling the notebook’s extension beyond Florida.

The workflow reads the wind-field data, performs interpolation to estimate winds at each property coordinate, and applies terrain adjustments to compute actual terrain-level wind speeds. For instance, given any hurricane dataset (e.g., Hurricane Michael), the notebook interpolates ARA’s 10-m open-terrain winds to specific property locations and modifies them based on local roughness and coastal proximity. The result is a spatially resolved dataset of adjusted 10-m wind speeds suitable for exposure modeling and vulnerability assessment.

Key functionalities include:

- **Interpolation:** Derives property-level wind speeds from gridded ARA/NIST hurricane data.  
- **Conversion:** Transforms wind speeds between averaging times (3-sec gusts, 1-min sustained) and exposure categories (marine, open, urban).  
- **Terrain Adjustment:** Applies roughness-based corrections and coastal modifiers using GeoTIFF rasters.  
- **Visualization:** Generates interactive Folium-based maps and static Matplotlib plots for analysis and validation.

#### Steps to Run
1. Download or clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mbakhshandeh2023/WindSpeed-Estimation-UseCase.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Wind_Speed_Estimation.ipynb`).  
3. Update file paths in `config1.txt` as needed.  
4. Run all notebook cells sequentially to perform interpolation, conversion, and mapping.  
5. Outputs (CSV files and HTML maps) will appear in the `Interpolation&ConversionOutput/` directory.

### Maping and Visulization
This usecase presents two complementary approaches to visualize estimated actual wind speed data, each with distinct strengths and suited for different purposes:

#### I.	Static Geospatial Map with Matplotlib and Contextily

This method generates a static map where data points are displayed as scatter points colored according to the actual 10 m height, 3-second gust wind speed (ActualT_3sg), utilizing a reversed Inferno colormap to enhance contrast. The Florida state boundaries are approximated by limiting the map extents, and a high-resolution satellite basemap from Esri World Imagery is incorporated via contextily to provide geographic context. The map features a vertical colorbar, a title, and a clean layout with axes hidden for clarity.

#### II.	Interactive Web Map with Folium

This method creates an interactive web map that can be embedded in Jupyter notebooks or saved as a standalone HTML file. Wind speed data points are represented as color-coded circle markers using a sequential YlOrRd colormap scaled to the range of wind speeds. Each marker features a clickable popup providing detailed, location-specific information, including geographic coordinates, ActualT_3sg, z0_raster, and dist_raster, aiding in the interpretation of local wind conditions. Additional interactive features such as a color legend, minimap overview, and layer control widgets enhance usability. The map can be saved as an HTML file for viewing in any web browser or displayed directly within a Jupyter Notebook.

### Background
This use case was developed to support advanced hurricane wind hazard and vulnerability modeling in Florida. It integrates validated wind engineering relationships, spatial interpolation methods, and terrain adjustment techniques within a reproducible Jupyter-based computational framework.

The use case is based on the Jupyter notebook published in the DesignSafe-CI Data Depot — “Wind Speed Estimation and Conversion” (DOI: 10.17603/ds2-kcxr-2683
) — and extends that work by providing a structured example for researchers and practitioners to reproduce, adapt, and integrate into broader catastrophe modeling workflows.
